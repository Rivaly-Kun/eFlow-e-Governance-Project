# Supabase database setup

`fresh_schema.sql` is the historical base schema. Apply it only when bootstrapping an empty local database, then apply every file in `migrations/` in filename order. Existing environments should apply only migrations that are not yet recorded by their Supabase migration history.

The current task-flow additions are:

1. `20260807000000_task_review_hardening.sql` — reviewer routing, immutable submission attempts, audited review/assignment/archive/delete RPCs, and subtask authorization.
2. `20260807000001_task_planning_enhancements.sql` — acceptance criteria, definition of done, dependencies, cancellation, and reminder dispatch.
3. `20260807000002_recurring_task_templates.sql` — recurring templates and idempotent task materialization.
4. `20260814000000_assistant_head_review_routing.sql` — generic Head/Assistant Head organization assignments, shared scoped-management enforcement, and reciprocal review routing for leadership-led tasks.

5. `20260815000000_project_creation_rls.sql` — scoped project and task creation for Super Admin, Head, Assistant Head, and legacy Department Head accounts.

6. `20260815000001_atomic_project_creation.sql` — authenticated atomic project, member, and milestone creation that avoids partial saves and browser-side RLS insert races.
7. `20260815000002_atomic_task_creation.sql` — authenticated task creation through a validated database RPC, preserving lifecycle triggers without browser-side task INSERT RLS failures.
8. `20260815000003_restore_review_decision_rpc.sql` — restores the deployed task-review decision contract when an older database is missing the RPC.
9. `20260815000004_fix_review_audit_hash_extension.sql` — makes approved-submission audit hashing independent of the extension schema search path.
10. `20260816000000_project_deletion.sql` — adds scoped, audited permanent project deletion for Head, Assistant Head, and Super Admin while retaining task history.
11. `20260816000001_subtask_evidence_review.sql` — replaces direct subtask check-off with progress, evidence submission, Team Leader review, revision, approval, and parent-task readiness enforcement.

15. `20260817000003_work_template_library.sql` — moves recurring work under Projects, adds governed personal/department subtask templates, seeds an editable Meeting Preparation checklist, and atomically applies templates with safe merge/replace protection.
16. `20260819000000_sir_gerson_access_control.sql` — unifies role defaults and individual page/action overrides, adds audited organization-scope grants, and extends canonical project/task scope helpers without weakening RLS.
17. `20260819000001_ordered_subtasks.sql` — normalizes subtask positions and adds one atomic, audited reorder RPC with workflow locking and exact-ID validation.
18. `20260819000002_monthly_productivity_leaderboard.sql` — adds approved-work monthly contribution snapshots, audited closed-month recalculation, Manila time boundaries, and automatic month close when `pg_cron` is enabled.

36. `20260822000005_advisory_collaboration_autosave.sql` — preserves consulted and observer organizations through draft autosave without adding them to the publication gate.
37. `20260822000006_fix_interdepartment_department_review_routing.sql` — routes non-governed collaboration tasks to the Head of each task's responsible organization, retains reciprocal Head/Assistant Head review, and repairs eligible active tasks created under the older proposal-owner fallback.
38. `20260822000007_inherit_activity_responsibility.sql` — removes independent task responsibility, makes every task inherit its Activity's primary/supporting offices, and keeps the duplicated snapshot keys synchronized only for backward-compatible commit contracts.
39. `20260822000008_department_budget_and_petty_cash.sql` — adds locked annual department budgets, manual-proposal funding commitments, task/subtask allocations, configurable petty-cash limits, receipt-backed liquidation, returned-cash tracking, financial notifications, and an immutable budget ledger for the department-only flow.
40. `20260822000009_single_department_publish_flow.sql` — removes department-only proposals from collaboration review, repairs drafts incorrectly placed in review, and enforces direct publication after normal staffing, schedule, and budget readiness checks.
41. `20260824000001_department_proposal_budget_enforcement.sql` — closes the AI-import bypass so every single-department proposal source reserves its full approved total from the locked annual budget exactly once when published.
42. `20260824000002_owner_department_budget_for_all_proposals.sql` — charges every published proposal to its owning department even when delivery or governance spans other organizations, and safely backfills previously published proposals skipped by the old collaboration bypass.

47. `20260824000007_task_budget_daily_petty_cash_workflow.sql` — makes task budgets authoritative, creates immutable operational allocation lines, replaces the annual petty-cash pool with a configurable daily release schedule, and adds Team Leader plus department review for requests and liquidations.
48. `20260824000008_budget_controls_and_resubmission.sql` — adds source-particular subtask allocations, correction/resubmission, recipient acknowledgement, audited appropriation adjustment and fiscal close, overdue maintenance, and financial completion guards.
49. `20260825000001_subtask_budget_distribution_guard.sql` — makes a Task Leader's distribution of an already-approved task budget immediately usable by the assigned subtask contributors, and blocks any parent-task petty-cash amount from being allocated a second time to subtasks.
50. `20260826000001_fix_subtask_budget_allocation_fiscal_reference.sql` — qualifies the fiscal-budget lookup in subtask allocation so the RPC cannot fail with an ambiguous `fiscal_budget_id` reference.
51. `20260826000002_task_leader_only_subtask_management.sql` — enforces Task Leader authority for subtask creation, ordering, standalone conversion, assignment, deadline, and deletion operations.
52. `20260826000003_dynamic_task_funding.sql` — consolidates cash into task/subtask context, reserves the shared proposal pool atomically, makes subtask caps optional, requires a source line and fund, skips self-endorsement for Task Leaders, records an append-only audit trail, and repairs proven collaboration workspace membership paths.
53. `20260826000004_release_correction_holds_and_notify_reviewers.sql` — releases temporary holds while a cash request is returned for correction, restores the hold atomically on resubmission, and alerts the Team Leader or fiscal reviewer when corrected funding re-enters their queue.

Apply these files in the listed order. The Assistant Head migration defensively
creates the two reviewer columns when absent, but it does not replace the full
review-hardening migration that supplies submission history, evidence records,
and the review RPCs.

The Sir Gerson migrations must be applied in the order above. After applying them, run `npm run verify:live-schema`. A hosted Supabase project with `pg_cron` enabled schedules the previous-month productivity snapshot automatically; otherwise a Super Admin can run the audited recalculation RPC for a closed month.

The collaboration and governance migrations are additive and must be applied in filename order. Do not copy their changes into `fresh_schema.sql` until they have been exercised against the required LEDIPO + CPDO + BPLO + OCIIB acceptance scenario. After applying them, restart the eFlow gateway and run `npm run verify:live-schema` so PostgREST confirms the new tables, columns, and RPC signatures.

The department-budget migrations gate every proposal, whether built manually or imported with AI. For the current phase, the owning organization funds the full proposal even when other offices participate. Shared-cost funding, transfers between departments, and Finance-office release authority remain deferred. Apply all department-budget migrations before opening Department Budget, contextual task funding, or financial Reviews; the live-schema verification checks their tables and RPCs.

These migrations do not require a service-role key in the browser. The frontend must use only the Supabase anonymous client; privileged behavior belongs in RLS policies, database functions, or the backend server.
