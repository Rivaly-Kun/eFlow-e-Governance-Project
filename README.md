# eFlow Web

eFlow is a role-based local-government work-management application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Supabase, and a JWT-protected FastAPI control gateway. It combines governed task and project workflows with a separately hosted local DeepSeek node.

## Current capabilities

- Role-specific workspaces for Super Admin, Department Head, Employee, Team Leader, Executive, Legislative, HRMO, Finance, and Settings users.
- Project and milestone workspaces with members, task rollups, archive/restore behavior, filtering, and schedule-health calculation.
- A shared Project Command Workspace with project editing, milestone sequencing, member-role management, operational task/milestone linking, complete ordered work hierarchy, review queue, activity timeline, and project-scoped CSV/PDF reports.
- Complete reviewed-task lifecycle: assignment, dependencies, progress, delegated subtasks, evidence submission, versioned review attempts, changes requested, approval, completion, reopening, cancellation, reminders, notifications, and audit history.
- Primary and backup reviewers, prevention of self-review, immutable submission evidence, and server-generated approval audit hashes.
- Recurring task templates, reminder/escalation generation, reports, announcements, chat/calls, permissions, organization management, and data-health checks.
- Proposal PDF decomposition through `deepseek-r1:8b`, including queued execution, employee recommendations, task/subtask generation, and structured draft review before commit. Proposal decomposition is AI-required: an unavailable or malformed AI response produces a visible error and never fabricates a local fallback proposal.
- Automatically saved, persistent inter-department proposal governance for both AI imports and manual plans: mixed staffing pools, activity/task-specific Board routing, required/consulted/observer participation, named approvers and delegates, quorum or sequential approval policies, private source PDFs, structured change requests, immutable revision approvals, final-delivery closeout, formal resolution/minutes records, a unified governance timeline, print-ready decision packets, and atomic commit/completion/archive operations. Proposed people remain unassigned until the approved revision commits.
- Automatic Cloudflare Quick Tunnel discovery through Supabase `system_config`, so deployed clients receive rotated AI gateway URLs without a rebuild or manual Admin entry.
- A shared FIFO AI queue: concurrent users receive queue positions while the local node processes one DeepSeek job at a time.
- Privileged Admin user creation through the authenticated gateway, including unique placeholder employee IDs, recovery of incomplete Auth/profile creation, and cleanup after partial failures.
- Unified User Management with Role Defaults, per-user access exceptions, page/action entitlements, audited cross-organization scope grants, and direct-route enforcement.
- Super Admin Backup & Export with recent-password confirmation, server-only `pg_dump`, JSONL, schema/data SQL, SHA-256 manifests, optional AES-256 disaster-recovery archives, audit history, and automatic temporary-file cleanup.
- Atomic drag/keyboard sequencing for numbered subtasks, preserving assignees, evidence, progress, submissions, and review history.
- An approved-work monthly contribution leaderboard with Manila calendar periods, transparent delivery/quality/speed/collaboration scoring, historical snapshots, department filtering, Reports summaries, and a private employee score view. It is deliberately excluded from AI assignment inputs.
- Cross-tab session protection that warns after 55 minutes of inactivity and signs out the local browser session at 60 minutes; background AI jobs, realtime traffic, and timers do not extend the session.
- Department-only fiscal control for manual proposals: the assigned Head prepares and locks the annual budget, proposal publication reserves funding, Heads/Assistants approve task and subtask allocations, employees request petty cash against approved work, and receipt-backed liquidation posts actual spending while returning unused cash. The default department petty-cash limit is ₱30,000, the default request ceiling is ₱5,000, and both remain configurable before the annual budget is locked.

## Development

Install dependencies and start eFlow:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts only the eFlow repository's two development processes:

- the control gateway on `127.0.0.1:8322`;
- the Vite frontend, normally on `5173` or the next available port.

The gateway launcher creates `server/.venv`, installs `server/requirements.txt` when needed, replaces a verified stale eFlow gateway, and reloads Python routes during development. You no longer need to run `python server/main.py` separately.

Focused commands remain available for diagnosis:

```powershell
npm run dev:gateway
npm run restart:gateway
npm run dev:frontend
```

### Backup & Export setup

The Super Admin Backup & Export tool needs the private PostgreSQL connection URI because it creates restore-grade `schema.sql` and `data.sql` files. In Supabase, open the project connection panel, copy the direct or session-pooler URI, and add it to the repository's private `.env` as `EFLOW_DATABASE_URL`. Never place that URI in a `VITE_` variable or send it to the browser.

On Windows, eFlow automatically finds `pg_dump.exe` from a standard PostgreSQL or pgAdmin installation. After changing the private `.env`, stop the current development process with `Ctrl+C` and run `npm run dev` again. The Data Tools readiness panel will then verify the gateway route, database URI, PostgreSQL tools, and visible public tables before enabling an export.

### Running eFlow with the AI server

The two repositories remain separate. Start each from its own terminal:

```powershell
# Terminal 1 — eFlow frontend and eFlow gateway
Set-Location "C:\Users\gabri\OneDrive\Desktop\EflowWeb"
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — private AI API, AI dashboard, and automatic tunnel publisher
Set-Location "C:\Users\gabri\OneDrive\Desktop\Ollama reactjs LLM DeepSeek Integration"
npm run dev
```

If the AI-side processes become duplicated or stuck, use its clean restart command:

```powershell
npm run restart
```

That command stops and replaces only the Ollama/AI repository's API, dashboard, queue worker, tunnel supervisor, and matching Quick Tunnel. It does not launch or stop eFlow.

| Service | Address | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| eFlow web | `http://localhost:5173` (or next free port) | Role workspaces and normal application UI |
| eFlow gateway | `http://127.0.0.1:8322` | Supabase JWT validation, Admin APIs, notification delivery, and AI proxy |
| Private AI API | `http://127.0.0.1:8321` | Model loading, inference, and FIFO jobs |
| AI dashboard | `http://localhost:5175` | Local AI administration and logs |
| Quick Tunnel | Rotating `https://*.trycloudflare.com` | Remote authenticated access to the eFlow gateway |

Normal eFlow work continues when the AI node is offline. Only AI-backed actions report the outage. The gateway and Cloudflare endpoint remain available for Admin and other control routes while the supervised AI process restarts.

Keep SMTP and service credentials in local environment files. Never expose a Supabase service-role key through a `VITE_` variable.

## Verification

```powershell
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run verify:client-secrets
python -m unittest discover -s server/tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

After applying the task-flow migrations to the target Supabase project, verify the live API schema with `npm run verify:live-schema`.

Authenticated browser smoke tests require dedicated non-production accounts:

```powershell
$env:EFLOW_E2E = "1"
$env:EFLOW_E2E_ACCOUNTS = '[{"role":"superadmin","email":"...","password":"..."}]'
npm run test:e2e
```

## Module map

Feature-owned application code lives under `src/app/features/`. Each feature exposes a deliberately small `index.ts`; files under old component paths are temporary compatibility bridges only.

- `app-shell`: providers, authentication gate, loading state, role resolution, and development quick-login handling.
- `navigation`: declarative role sections, default destinations, sidebar state, lazy role-content loading, and role dispatch.
- `guided-tours`: accessible role-aware onboarding with first-login prompts, page walkthroughs, smooth spotlight highlighting, keyboard navigation, automatic scrolling, replay controls, optional natural English AI voice narration, and versioned per-user resume and voice preferences.
- `tasks`: task contracts, mapping, realtime subscriptions, focused mutation/review/activity/archive services, recurring-task scheduling, maintenance, and decomposed list/Kanban/hierarchy/timeline boards with controller hooks and a consistent overflow-management menu.
- `work-templates`: the Projects-owned template workspace for recurring whole-task schedules and reusable subtask checklists, including personal/department sharing, leadership approval, editable assignment previews, and guarded merge-or-replace application.
- `reviews`: reviewer authorization, review services, immutable submission history, inbox, and decision components.
- `subtasks`: permission-aware subtask services and task checklist UI.
- `session-security`: trusted human-activity tracking, cross-tab coordination, inactivity warning/countdown, and local-only one-hour sign-out.
- `productivity`: approved-work Manila-month scoring, live and immutable snapshot readers, department leaderboard, employee self-view, and Reports summary components.
- `ai`: Supabase-authenticated AI gateway client, dynamic Quick Tunnel endpoint discovery, AI-only runtime gating, FIFO job submission/polling, queue-position updates, model configuration, and common response handling.
- `team-management`: the shared Department Head operations model for live task/subtask workload, attention signals, review quality, delivery health, skill coverage, safe lead/member reassignment, and AI-compatible employee coaching inputs. The persisted AI assignment fields remain `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `notes`, and `tags`; the clearer “Development areas” label still writes to `weaknesses` for compatibility.
- `reports`: the Department Head report library for department operations, projects, full team/subtask contributions, review attempts, evidence, risks, and lifecycle history; exact-row CSV/PDF export; and an optional queue-aware DeepSeek management brief using only visible permission-scoped rows. The legacy shared Super Admin report workspace remains intact.
- `projects`, `employees`, `announcements`: active workflow workspaces with the shared Project Command tabs, project query/mutation/member/milestone operations, the manual/AI work-plan entry points and Projects-owned template library, PDS parser stages, employee core-work pages, and announcement inbox controllers kept in focused modules.
- `proposal-import`: PDF extraction, AI-required per-part/whole-document DeepSeek decomposition, hierarchy validation/repair of the same AI response, employee-scope selection, draft model, queue-aware controller hook, assignment UI, import cockpit, and a separate project/task commit operation. It contains no silent non-AI proposal fallback.
- `interdepartment-collaboration`: the shared AI/manual persistent-draft engine, organization participation and responsibility model, mixed-team staffing review, private backend recommendation client, source-document access, messages, formal changes, revision-bound named approvals, per-task governance routing, final closeout, resolution/minutes records, decision packets, realtime refresh, and atomic commit/completion/archive boundaries.
- `budget`: annual department appropriations, PDF-style proposal budget schedules, publication funding gates, proposal commitments, task/subtask allocations, petty-cash requests, receipt uploads and liquidation review, utilization warnings, notification routing, and the immutable financial ledger. This first slice intentionally covers department-only manual plans; inter-department funding rules remain a separate phase.
- `role-department-head`, `role-executive`, `role-finance`, `role-hrmo`, `role-legislative`: role registries and focused page components, including committee, session, councilor, portfolio, finance, audit, and project-health submodules.
- `chat-calls`: chat/call public API plus separate controller, channel-list, active-chat, reaction, and message-codec modules.
- `administration`, `organization`, `permissions`, `audit`, `settings`: administrative boundaries, including componentized identity/access management, secure Supabase Backup & Export, and organization-tree tooling.

Generated design imports and reusable UI primitive collections can remain physically long when they already consist of small independent functions; application page controllers and service workflows should not.
